# Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares of each company competing in a market: $HHI=\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_{i}^{2}$ where $s_{i}$ is the market share of company $i$ and $n$ is the number of companies in the market. Thus, for a market held by two companies with market shares of 30% and 70%, the $HHI$ is $HHI=0,3^{2}+0,7^{2}=0,09+0,49=0,58$.

The $HHI$ ranges from $\frac{1}{n}$ to 1, and when market shares are provided as percentages, the $HHI$ can go up to 10,000. Typically, above a threshold of 0.25 (or 2,500), the market is considered concentrated.

In general, the closer the $HHI$ is to 1 (or 10,000), the more monopolistic the market is.

A normalized $HHI$ also exists, ensuring index values between 0 and 1, regardless of the input data. The formula for the normalized $HHI$ is: $\hat{HHI}=\frac{HHI-\frac{1}{n}}{1-\frac{1}{n}}$
