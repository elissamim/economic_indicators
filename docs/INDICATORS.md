# Concentration Ratio ($CR_{k}$)

A concentration ratio for a pre-specified number $k$ of firms ($CR_{k}$) is the sum of the market shares of the $k$ largest companies in a market of $n$ companies. $CR_{k}$ shows the combined market share of the $k$ largest companies in the industry. The usual values for $k$ are $\lbrace 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \rbrace$ corresponding to $CR_{3}, CR_{4}, CR_{5}, CR_{6}, CR_{7}, CR_{8}$. For example, $CR_{4}$ defines the combined market share of the four largest firms in a market. The formula of the concentration ratio is given by : $CR_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}s_{i}=s_{1}+s_{2}+ \ldots + s_{k}$, where $s_{j}$ is the market share of the jth-largest company in the market (for example $s_{1}$ is the market share of the largest company in the industry).

The most commonly used concentration ratios are $CR_{4}$ and $CR_{8}$, and their values range from 0 (lowest concetration level) to 1 (highest concentration level), or from 0 to 100 if market shares are expressed in percentages. The different possible concentration levels are the following :
- Perfect concentration : from $CR_{k}=0$ to $CR_{k}=\frac{k}{n}$, all firms have equal market share
- Low concentration : from $CR_{k}=\frac{k}{n}$ to $CR_{k}=0,4$
- Medium concentration : from $CR_{k}=0,4$ to $CR_{k}=0,7$, the market is likely an oligopoly : the industry is dominated by a small number of firms each with significant market shares
- High concentration :  from $CR_{k}=0,7$ to $CR_{k}=1$, this concentration level ranges from oligopoly to monopoly

# Herfindahl-Hirschman Index ($HHI$)

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is calculated by summing the squares of the market shares of each company competing in a market: $HHI=\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_{i}^{2}$ where $s_{i}$ is the market share of company $i$ and $n$ is the number of companies in the market. Thus, for a market held by two companies with market shares of 30% and 70%, the $HHI$ is $HHI=0,3^{2}+0,7^{2}=0,09+0,49=0,58$.

The $HHI$ ranges from $\frac{1}{n}$ to 1, and when market shares are provided as percentages, the $HHI$ can go up to 10,000. Typically, above a threshold of 0.25 (or 2,500), the market is considered concentrated.

In general, the closer the $HHI$ is to 1 (or 10,000), the more monopolistic the market is.

A normalized $HHI$ also exists, ensuring index values between 0 and 1, regardless of the input data. The formula for the normalized $HHI$ is: $\hat{HHI}=\frac{HHI-\frac{1}{n}}{1-\frac{1}{n}}$
