# Public Health Economics indicators for hospital activity measurement

### Analysis of MCO activity

Three different measures have been selected to analyze activity in the field of MCO stays:  

- **The number of stays in full hospitalization and outpatient care**: This is the simplest measure of hospital activity. A stay refers to the period during which a patient is hospitalized:  
  - Full hospitalization (HC) includes all stays of at least one night.  
  - Outpatient hospitalization (HP) includes stays without an overnight stay (except in case of death).  

- **The number of equivalent days**: This measure synthesizes the evolution of activity associated with full hospitalizations and outpatient hospitalizations (an outpatient stay is valued as one day), taking into account the length of stays. This "physical" measure of activity has the advantage of being easily interpretable. It is notably used by the Directorate for Research, Studies, Evaluation, and Statistics (DREES) in its annual overview of healthcare facilities.  

- **The economic volume**: This corresponds to activity-related revenues based on the rates associated with each category of stays, adjusted to neutralize the "price effects" caused by the annual revaluation of these rates. While the evolution of the number of equivalent days is a concrete and simple indicator to calculate, it does not account for differences in costs and, therefore, in health insurance revenues related to hospitalization days depending on the treated pathologies. The economic volume aims to factor in these structural effects: the activity volume is thus calculated as the number of stays weighted by a coefficient representing their cost for health insurance. It does not reflect the "actual" revenues of healthcare facilities, which benefit from annual price effects linked to the revaluation of these rates. An identical rate is applied between former DG and former OQN establishments to make their economic volume comparable.  

- **The average length of stay (DMS)**: The DMS is the ratio of the number of days to the number of stays. This is calculated only for full hospitalizations.
